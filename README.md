# BanglaBeats: A Comprehensive Dataset of Bengali Songs for Music Genre Classification Tasks

This repository contains the codebase for the models and scripts developed to assess the BanglaBeats dataset. This work was titled [BanglaBeats: A Comprehensive Dataset of Bengali Songs for Music Genre Classification Tasks](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/iccit60459.2023.10441288) and published at the 26th IEEE ICCIT.

### Models and Performance

1. **CNN Model:** Our Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model achieved exceptional performance, boasting a test accuracy of 88%. This model surpassed all other existing CNN models in this domain.

2. **Pre-trained Models:** We also explored the effectiveness of pre-trained models, including DistilHubert and Wav2Vec2-Base-960h. These models yielded impressive test accuracies of 83.36% and 84.94%, respectively.
